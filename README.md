ESG-KLI is a powerful automation tool built to streamline the extraction of legislation and regulation data across multiple jurisdictions in European countries, North America, 
and selected Asian countries. In the past, local country teams had to manually search, enter keywords, navigate official legal portals, and extract data step by step. This 
process was slow, repetitive, and prone to errors. 
With ESG-KLI, we deliver a future-proof, fully automated solution:
