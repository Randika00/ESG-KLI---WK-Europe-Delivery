ESG-KLI is a powerful automation tool built to streamline the extraction of legislation and regulation data across multiple jurisdictions in European countries, North America, 
and selected Asian countries. In the past, local country teams had to manually search, enter keywords, navigate official legal portals, and extract data step by step. This 
process was slow, repetitive, and prone to errors. 
With ESG-KLI, we deliver a future-proof, fully automated solution:

          * Each country is equipped with a dedicated automation script tailored to its legal portals.
          * Once triggered, the tool runs independently and captures large volumes of legal and compliance data in minutes.
          * The automation process extracts and organizes all key information, including:
             * Jurisdiction
             * Original Title
             * Source Link
             * Type of Regulation
             * Date of Adoption
             * Entry Into Force Date
All data is then compiled into a clear, structured, and high-quality Excel file, ensuring that results are instantly usable for reporting, compliance monitoring, or integration with enterprise systems.
